            <p>Hello there!!</p>
            <p> I am a computer engineering student at The University of British Columbia. My passion is software programming and I have experience in full-stack development and data analysis. I love to write code and explore what software engineering can offer us â€“ programming is like trying to solve a puzzle that just keeps going and require my full focus!</p>
